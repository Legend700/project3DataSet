5G Network Coverage Regression Analysis

1. Introduction

Welcome to the 5G Network Coverage Regression Analysis. In this project, we analyze a dataset containing global 5G deployments and apply regression techniques to predict latitude based on deployment-related features.

Objectives:

Understand and preprocess the 5G dataset.

Implement a baseline linear regression model and evaluate it using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Explore feature engineering and alternative regression models to enhance performance.

Reflect on the potential impact of 5G expansion trends.

Dataset Used:

The dataset includes the following key columns:

Operator – Telecom provider deploying 5G.

City Name – Location where 5G is available.

Deployment Type – Type of 5G deployment (e.g., 5G NR).

Status – Commercial availability status.

Latitude & Longitude – Geographical coordinates of deployments.

2. Data Loading and Exploration

Loading the Dataset:

We begin by loading the dataset and inspecting its structure.

Basic Statistics and Overview

The dataset consists of 145,629 entries and 6 columns:

4 categorical columns: operator, city_name, deployment_type, status

2 numerical columns: latitude, longitude

Handling Categorical Variables

Since operator, deployment_type, and status are categorical variables, we apply Label Encoding to convert them into numerical representations before regression modeling.

3. Visualizing Data Relationships

2. 5G Deployments by Type

A bar chart displays the distribution of different types of 5G deployments.

3. 5G Deployment Status Distribution

A bar chart highlights the number of commercial 5G deployments versus other statuses.

4. Regression Model

Defining the Regression Problem

We aim to predict the latitude of a 5G deployment based on:

Operator (Encoded)

Deployment Type (Encoded)

Status (Encoded)

Longitude

Preprocessing Steps:

Sampling the dataset – We use 5000 rows to optimize memory usage.

Label Encoding – Convert categorical variables into numerical values.

Splitting Data – Train-test split (80% training, 20% testing).

Model Training – Use Linear Regression as the baseline model.

5. Evaluation

Performance Metric: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

The baseline Linear Regression model achieves an RMSE of 19.39.

This suggests an average latitude prediction error of 19.39 degrees, indicating room for improvement.

Potential Improvements

Feature Engineering – Incorporate additional relevant features.

Alternative Models – Try Ridge Regression or Decision Trees.

Larger Training Set – Use more data to improve generalization.

6. Conclusion

This project demonstrates an initial 5G deployment regression model, predicting latitude using categorical and numerical features. While the model provides a starting point, further optimizations, alternative models, and additional feature exploration could significantly enhance prediction accuracy.
